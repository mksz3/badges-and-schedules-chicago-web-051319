 # Question 4
    # The method `printer` should output first the results of the batch_badge_creator method and then of the assign_rooms method to the screen - this way you can output
    # the badges and room assignments one at a time.
    # To make this test pass, make sure you are iterating through your badges and room assignments lists.
